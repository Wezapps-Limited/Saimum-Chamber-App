                        explanation of these rights.</li>

                    <li>Your principal rights under data protection law are:
                        <ol>

                            <li>the right to access;

                    </li>
                    <li>You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your
                        personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with
                        certain additional information. That additional information includes details
                        of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned
                        and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms
                        of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal
                        data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies
                        may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can access your personal data by
                        visiting your 'My Account' area when logged into our website.</li>

                    <li>You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified
                        and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any
                        incomplete personal data about you completed.</li>

                    <li>In some circumstances you have the right to erasure of your personal
                        data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data
                        are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were
                        collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based
                        processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable
                        data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and
                        the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are
                        exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where
                        processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression
                        and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the
                        establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>

                    <li>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on
                        grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the
                        legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the
                        performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                        any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate
                        interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection,
                        we will cease to process the personal information unless we can
                        demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which
                        override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the
                        establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>

                    <li>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for
                        scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds
                        relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for
                        the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</li>

                    <li>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes
                        data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a
                        supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the
                        EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the
                        place of the alleged infringement.</li>

                    <li>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal
                        information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any
                        time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the
                        withdrawal.</li>
